title: Literate Programming in ConTeXt
---

This organisation is a collection of tools used to use ConTeXt to write
literate programs which are proven correct to a Mathematical level of
argumentation.

The original instigation for this collection of tools has been to explore
Mathematical Physics from a radically programmatic point of view. If it
can't be computed, then it does not exist.
